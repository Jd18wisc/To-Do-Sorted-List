# To-Do-Sorted-List
Version 1.0 (2/10/21)
First completed section of a to-do list application I am developing.

File descriptions
  SortedList.java
    - A sorted, doubly-linked list made up of ToDoItems
    - To assist in sorting, the search for the insert starting index begins where the
      last current node was
      - It will then move either up or down the list to the node
  ToDoItem.java
    - The nodes to be added into the to-do list
  Tests.java
    - A series of JUnit tests that demostrate the functionalities of the list and show
      that they all work as expected
